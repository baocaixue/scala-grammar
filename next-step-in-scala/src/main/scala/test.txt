    It is spring again and the window can be left open as often as one would like. As spring comes in through the windows,
so people -- unable to bear staying inside any longer -- go outdoors.

    The spring outside, however, is much too cheap, for the sun shines on everything, and so does not seem as bright as that
which shoots into the darkness of the house. Outside the sun-sloshed breeze blows everywhere, but it is not so lively as
that which stirs the gloominess inside the house.

    Even the chirping of the birds sounds so thin and broken that the quietness of the house is needed to set it off.
It seems that spring was always meant to be put behind a windowpane for show, just like a picture in a frame.
